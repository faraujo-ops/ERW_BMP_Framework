# PRISMA protocol — ERW & BMP Framework

## Title
From Science to Practice: Integrating Enhanced Rock Weathering into Best Management Practices

## Objectives
- To systematically review the integration of Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) with Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) and Best Management Practices (BMPs).
- To identify synergies with existing frameworks such as liming, 4R Nutrient Stewardship, and Environmental Farm Plans (EFP).
- To analyze adoption determinants beyond technical performance, including economic, social, and institutional factors.

## Eligibility Criteria
- **Inclusion**: Peer-reviewed articles, reports, and grey literature from 2000–2025 focusing on ERW, agricultural liming, SAP/BMP adoption, and climate mitigation.
- **Exclusion**: Opinion pieces, non-agronomic studies, and work without measurable agronomic or climate outcomes.

## Information Sources
- Databases: Web of Science, Scopus, CAB Abstracts, AGRICOLA.
- Grey literature: Provincial guidelines, OMAFRA and OSCIA reports, 4R Nutrient Stewardship factsheets, Environmental Farm Plan manuals.

## Search Strategy
- Example keywords:  
  - (“enhanced rock weathering” OR wollastonite OR basalt OR silicate)  
  - AND (agriculture OR farming OR cropland)  
  - AND (adoption OR “best management practice” OR BMP OR “4R” OR “Environmental Farm Plan”).  
- Boolean operators and truncations adapted for each database.

## Study Selection
- Two reviewers will screen titles and abstracts independently.
- Full-text screening for relevance to ERW, liming, and BMP adoption.
- Discrepancies resolved through discussion.

## Data Extraction
- **Technical outcomes**: Soil pH, CCE, cation balance, crop productivity, CO₂ removal, N₂O fluxes.
- **Institutional outcomes**: Alignment with 4R principles, EFP checklists, policy frameworks.
- **Adoption outcomes**: Compatibility, relative advantage, trialability, observability, extension support, risk perception.

## Risk of Bias
- Double screening by two reviewers.
- Inter-rater reliability assessed (Cohen’s κ).
- Sensitivity analysis for grey literature inclusion.

## Data Synthesis
- Evidence coded into Mechanism–Context–Outcome (MCO) heuristics.
- Three integration matrices: technical, architectural, and adoption.
- Realist synthesis to link technical efficacy with adoption predictors.
- Outputs: PRISMA flow diagram, integration matrices, logic model, adoption ladder.

## Registration
- This protocol will be hosted in a public GitHub repository for transparency and reproducibility.
